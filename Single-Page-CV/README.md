# Single-Page CV — index.html

Project URL - https://roadmap.sh/projects/single-page-cv

Overview
--------
This is a compact, single-file Curriculum Vitae (CV) built as a static HTML page. The core file is `index.html`, and it contains basic meta tags, a favicon reference, and the CV markup (name, contact, skills, education, experience and links).

Purpose
-------
- Provide a lightweight, easy-to-host single-page resume.
- Demonstrate simple SEO and Open Graph meta tags for sharing.
- Serve as a template you can copy, edit, or expand for personal use.

Highlights / Features
---------------------
- Single file: no build tools required — just open `index.html` in a browser.
- Basic SEO: has `description`, `keywords`, and `author` meta tags.
- Open Graph tags for better previews when sharing on social media.
- Favicon reference.
- Clean, semantic markup designed for easy customization.

How to Use
----------
1. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the CV.
2. Edit the file directly in any text editor (VS Code, Notepad, Sublime, etc.)—change name, title, skills, contact info, and experience.
3. Replace or remove placeholder content (e.g., `Hans Gruber`, `DieHard@Nakatomi.com`).
4. Add or replace the favicon `afk-favicon.jpg` in the same directory or update the `href` to point to your favicon.
